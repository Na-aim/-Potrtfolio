<h1>The Space Race and exploring the unknown</h1> 
<img src="astronaut-1.jpg" alt="astronaut-1.jpg"width="600px" height="366"  >
<p>Human space exploration helps to address fundamental questions about our place in the Universe and the history of our solar system. Through addressing the challenges related to human space exploration we expand technology, create new industries, and help to foster a peaceful connection with other nations.</p>
   <p>At the time of the moon landing in 1969, many people envisioned that by the beginning of the 21st century, space travel would become routine, and we would be visiting other planets in our solar system and perhaps even daring to venture into interstellar space.</p>
   <p>Sadly, that future hasn't yet arrived. In fact, some people have started to question whether we need space travel anymore. Wasn't going to the moon good enough? Maybe the U.S. should leave space exploration to private companies -- or even other countries.
  </p>
        <p>As we reflect on the Apollo program, it’s worth noting some of the events that—had they gone differently—could have led to very different outcomes
           on the world stage. The Space Race (1957-1975) between the US and the Soviet Union was an outgrowth of the Cold War. During this era, each of the
            two countries attempted to assert its prowess (scientifically, technologically, and economically) in various domains including land, sea and air,
             and eventually extending into space. In some ways, the American public viewed the Cold War and the Space Race in particular as a battle between
              good (represented by democracy) and evil (represented by communism).</p>
              <p>The Soviet launch in 1957 of Sputnik, the first ever artificial earth-orbiting satellite, followed by Yuri Gagarin’s historic flight in 1961
                 as the first human to fly in space seemed to give the Soviets an early edge in the Space Race. These Soviet “firsts” prompted President John
                  F. Kennedy’s famous 1962 “we choose to go to the moon” speech at Rice University in Houston. In it, JFK pledged his commitment to America’s
                   technological progress and established space exploration as a national priority, affirming the role of NASA, which had just been
                    established in 1958, and effectively kicking off the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo human spaceflight missions.</p><br>
