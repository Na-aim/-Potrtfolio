<h2>New Technologies and Research</h2>
<p>Humans did not evolve to go into space, but we go there anyway. That has led to the development of various technologies that feed back into the economy
   and improve our lives on Earth</p>
   <h2>Asteroids Don’t Care About Us</h2>
   <p>Speaking of saving lives, space exploration could save all our lives. The solar system has calmed down a lot since the early eons, but there are 
     still an unknown number of big asteroids and comets out there that could smack into the planet and really ruin your day.</p>
     <h2>Colonization Is the Ultimate Backup</h2>
     <p>There are currently more than 7 billion humans, which is a lot. However, we’re all crammed together on this one planet. If something happened 
       to Earth, our species could be wiped out.</p>
       <h2>Space Mining Could Save the World</h2>
       <p>As we develop new technologies on Earth, the strain on our natural resources continues to increase. The extraction of valuable minerals has led
          to a host of problems, including environmental damage and human exploitation, but there’s a wealth of precious materials in space.</p>
          <h2>We Are Explorers</h2>
          <p>There are more practical reasons for space exploration, but one of the principal reasons we must continue is that we’re explorers. That’s why
             humans number in the billions — from our earliest upright steps, we’ve endeavored to learn more about the world around us, and this allowed
              us to build civilization. Exploring space is an opportunity not only to discover new worlds and build advanced technologies, but to work
               together toward a larger goal irrespective of nationality, race, or gender. If we stop exploring, we stop being human. <div class="center"><img src="spaceship.jpg" alt="spaceship.jpg"></div>
