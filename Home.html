<h1>The Space Race and exploring the unknown</h1> 
<img src="astronaut-1.jpg" alt="astronaut-1.jpg"width="600px" height="366"  >
<p>For those of us born before the late 1960’s, it was an event we will never forget. Like a handful of other history-shaping events that have taken place
   over that same timeframe, I’ll never forget where I was when I heard the news of the Apollo 11 moon landing. I was a young kid at summer camp in 
   Washington state when Neil Armstrong’s crackly message from the moon was broadcast to the world: “That’s one small step for man—one giant leap for 
   mankind.” An estimated 500 million people around the world vicariously experienced this historic event.</p>
   <p>This significant incident inspired a generation of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Math)-oriented kids—myself included—to pursue the education
      required to support NASA’s space program. For me, that path involved pursuing graduate studies in aerospace and mechanical engineering at Stanford 
      University, and working with NASA on spacesuit design for future Moon and Mars missions. I also spent more than a decade doing astronaut training 
      and working as a spaceflight test crewmember with Lockheed Martin on NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and International Space Station programs.
       I got to do a lot of really fun simulation and training activities, including flying jets, jumping out of planes, diving in neutral buoyancy tanks,
        working in spacesuits, and flying aboard NASA’s KC135 “Vomit Comet.”</p>
        <p>As we reflect on the Apollo program, it’s worth noting some of the events that—had they gone differently—could have led to very different outcomes
           on the world stage. The Space Race (1957-1975) between the US and the Soviet Union was an outgrowth of the Cold War. During this era, each of the
            two countries attempted to assert its prowess (scientifically, technologically, and economically) in various domains including land, sea and air,
             and eventually extending into space. In some ways, the American public viewed the Cold War and the Space Race in particular as a battle between
              good (represented by democracy) and evil (represented by communism).</p>
              <p>The Soviet launch in 1957 of Sputnik, the first ever artificial earth-orbiting satellite, followed by Yuri Gagarin’s historic flight in 1961
                 as the first human to fly in space seemed to give the Soviets an early edge in the Space Race. These Soviet “firsts” prompted President John
                  F. Kennedy’s famous 1962 “we choose to go to the moon” speech at Rice University in Houston. In it, JFK pledged his commitment to America’s
                   technological progress and established space exploration as a national priority, affirming the role of NASA, which had just been
                    established in 1958, and effectively kicking off the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo human spaceflight missions.</p><br>
